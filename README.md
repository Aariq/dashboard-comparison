<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dashboard-comparison is to create two nearly identical, simple dashboards---one using `shiny` and `bslib` in `app.R` and one using the new dashboard format in Quarto v1.4 in `app.Qmd`.

I'm very curious to get feedback from folks at all levels of experience on which one of these seems "friendlier" to work with.  Eventually I might make a poll or something!
